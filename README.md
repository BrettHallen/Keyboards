# Keyboards
A list of my keyboard projects.<br>

They are in various states of progress: being designed, fabricated but not tested, fully tested.<br>

Keyboards listed as "troubleshooting" are designed to be simple or small keyboards that can be used for troubleshooting a bare motherboard, rather than having to connect a possibly cumbersome full-size keyboard.<br>
